# pomodoro
Project in the Reykjavik academy of web development


I made a simple pomodoro clock with simple UI

I utilized the skeleton CSS framework for the layout.

You can start the timer and it will count from 25 minutes.

Then it will start again from 5 minutes.

After that the session will get recorded.
